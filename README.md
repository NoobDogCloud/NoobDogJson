# NoobDogJson

NoobDogJson is a Java library based on JSON-simple project that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.


### NoobDogJson Goals
 * Provide the best performance on the server-side
 * Provide simple mapper(class<?>) and mapper(object) methods to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa
 * Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON
 * Extensive support of Java Generics
 * Allow custom representations for objects
 * Support arbitrarily complex objects (with deep inheritance hierarchies and extensive use of generic types)
